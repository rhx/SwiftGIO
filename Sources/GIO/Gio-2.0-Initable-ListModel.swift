/// convenient method of returning lists of data, with support for
/// updates.
/// 
/// Each object in the list may also report changes in itself via some
/// mechanism (normally the `GObject::notify` signal).  Taken together
/// with the `GListModel::items-changed` signal, this provides for a list
/// that can change its membership, and in which the members can change
/// their individual properties.
/// 
/// A good example would be the list of visible wireless network access
/// points, where each access point can report dynamic properties such as
/// signal strength.
/// 
/// It is important to note that the `GListModel` itself does not report
/// changes to the individual items.  It only reports changes to the list
/// membership.  If you want to observe changes to the objects themselves
/// then you need to connect signals to the objects that you are
/// interested in.
/// 
/// All items in a `GListModel` are of (or derived from) the same type.
/// `g_list_model_get_item_type()` returns that type.  The type may be an
/// interface, in which case all objects in the list must implement it.
/// 
/// The semantics are close to that of an array:
/// `g_list_model_get_n_items()` returns the number of items in the list and
/// `g_list_model_get_item()` returns an item at a (0-based) position. In
/// order to allow implementations to calculate the list length lazily,
/// you can also iterate over items: starting from 0, repeatedly call
/// `g_list_model_get_item()` until it returns `nil`.
/// 
/// An implementation may create objects lazily, but must take care to
/// return the same object for a given position until all references to
/// it are gone.
/// 
/// On the other side, a consumer is expected only to hold references on
/// objects that are currently "user visible", in order to facilitate the
/// maximum level of laziness in the implementation of the list and to
/// reduce the required number of signal connections at a given time.
/// 
/// This interface is intended only to be used from a single thread.  The
/// thread in which it is appropriate to use it depends on the particular
/// implementation, but typically it will be from the thread that owns
/// the [thread-default main context](#g-main-context-push-thread-default)
/// in effect at the time that the model was created.

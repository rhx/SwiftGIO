/// For a concrete class that implements these methods and properties, see `ActionGroup`.
/// Alternatively, use `ActionGroupRef` as a lighweight, `unowned` reference if you already have an instance you just want to use.
///
/// `GActionGroup` represents a group of actions. Actions can be used to

/// a menu.
/// 
/// The main way to interact with the actions in a GActionGroup is to
/// activate them with `g_action_group_activate_action()`. Activating an

/// change its state, but it is also possible to set the state by calling
/// `g_action_group_change_action_state()`.
/// 
/// As typical example, consider a text editing application which has an

/// this would be a stateful action, with a boolean state. Activating the
/// action would toggle the state.
///

/// `GAppInfo` and `GAppLaunchContext` are used for describing and launching

/// 
/// As of GLib 2.20, URIs will always be converted to POSIX paths
/// (using `g_file_get_path()`) when using `g_app_info_launch()` even if
/// the application requested an URI and not a POSIX path. For example
/// for a desktop-file based application with Exec key `totem
/// `U`` and a single URI, `sftp://foo/file.avi`, then
/// `/home/user/.gvfs/sftp on foo/file.avi` will be passed. This will
/// only work if a set of suitable GIO extensions (such as gvfs 2.26
/// compiled with FUSE support), is available and operational; if this
/// is not the case, the URI will be passed unmodified to the application.
/// Some URIs, such as `mailto:`, of course cannot be mapped to a POSIX
/// path (in gvfs there's no FUSE mount for it); such URIs will be
/// passed unmodified to the application.
/// 
/// Specifically for gvfs 2.26 and later, the POSIX URI will be mapped
/// back to the GIO URI in the `GFile` constructors (since gvfs
/// implements the `GVfs` extension point). As such, if the application
/// needs to examine the URI, it needs to use `g_file_get_uri()` or
/// similar on `GFile`. In other words, an application cannot assume
/// that the URI passed to e.g. `g_file_new_for_commandline_arg()` is
/// equal to the result of `g_file_get_uri()`. The following snippet
/// illustrates this:
/// 
/// ```
/// GFile *f;
/// char *uri;
/// 
/// file = g_file_new_for_commandline_arg (uri_from_commandline);
/// 
/// uri = g_file_get_uri (file);
/// strcmp (uri, uri_from_commandline) == 0;
/// g_free (uri);
/// 
/// if (g_file_has_uri_scheme (file, "cdda"))
///   {
///     // do something special with uri
///   }
/// g_object_unref (file);
/// ```
/// 
/// This code will work when both `cdda://sr0/Track 1.wav` and
/// `/home/user/.gvfs/cdda on sr0/Track 1.wav` is passed to the
/// application. It should be noted that it's generally not safe
/// for applications to rely on the format of a particular URIs.
/// Different launcher applications (e.g. file managers) may have

/// Provides a base class for implementing asynchronous function results.
/// 
/// Asynchronous operations are broken up into two separate operations
/// which are chained together by a `GAsyncReadyCallback`. To begin
/// an asynchronous operation, provide a `GAsyncReadyCallback` to the
/// asynchronous function. This callback will be triggered when the
/// operation has completed, and must be run in a later iteration of
/// the [thread-default main context](#g-main-context-push-thread-default)
/// from where the operation was initiated. It will be passed a
/// `GAsyncResult` instance filled with the details of the operation's
/// success or failure, the object the asynchronous function was
/// started for and any error codes returned. The asynchronous callback
/// function is then expected to call the corresponding `"_finish()`"
/// function, passing the object the function was called for, the
/// `GAsyncResult` instance, and (optionally) an `error` to grab any
/// error conditions that may have occurred.
/// 
/// The `"_finish()`" function for an operation takes the generic result
/// (of type `GAsyncResult`) and returns the specific result that the
/// operation in question yields (e.g. a `GFileEnumerator` for a
/// "enumerate children" operation). If the result or error status of the
/// operation is not needed, there is no need to call the `"_finish()`"
/// function; GIO will take care of cleaning up the result and error
/// information after the `GAsyncReadyCallback` returns. You can pass
/// `nil` for the `GAsyncReadyCallback` if you don't need to take any
/// action at all after the operation completes. Applications may also
/// take a reference to the `GAsyncResult` and call `"_finish()`" later;
/// however, the `"_finish()`" function may be called at most once.
///

    /// data after the data in `inbuf`, the flag `G_CONVERTER_INPUT_AT_END` must be set.
    /// The loop will be (unless some error happens) returning `G_CONVERTER_CONVERTED`
    /// each time until all data is consumed and all output is produced, then

    /// in a decompression converter where the end of data is detectable from the
    /// data (and there might even be other data after the end of the compressed data).
    /// 
    /// When some data has successfully been converted `bytes_read` and is set to
    /// the number of bytes read from `inbuf`, and `bytes_written` is set to indicate
    /// how many bytes was written to `outbuf`. If there are more data to output
    /// or consume (i.e. unless the `G_CONVERTER_INPUT_AT_END` is specified) then
    /// `G_CONVERTER_CONVERTED` is returned, and if no more data is to be output
    /// then `G_CONVERTER_FINISHED` is returned.

    /// Some errors need special handling:
    /// 
    /// `G_IO_ERROR_NO_SPACE` is returned if there is not enough space
    /// to write the resulting converted data, the application should
    /// call the function again with a larger `outbuf` to continue.
    /// 
    /// `G_IO_ERROR_PARTIAL_INPUT` is returned if there is not enough
    /// input to fully determine what the conversion should produce,
    /// and the `G_CONVERTER_INPUT_AT_END` flag is not set. This happens for
    /// example with an incomplete multibyte sequence when converting text,
    /// or when a regexp matches up to the end of the input (and may match
    /// further input). It may also happen when `inbuf_size` is zero and
    /// there is no more data to produce.
    /// 
    /// When this happens the application should read more input and then
    /// call the function again. If further input shows that there is no
    /// more data call the function again with the same data but with
    /// the `G_CONVERTER_INPUT_AT_END` flag set. This may cause the conversion
    /// to finish as e.g. in the regexp match case (or, to fail again with
    /// `G_IO_ERROR_PARTIAL_INPUT` in e.g. a charset conversion where the
    /// input is actually partial).
    /// 
    /// After `g_converter_convert()` has returned `G_CONVERTER_FINISHED` the
    /// converter object is in an invalid state where its not allowed
    /// to call `g_converter_convert()` anymore. At this time you can only
    /// free the object or call `g_converter_reset()` to reset it to the
    /// initial state.
    /// 
    /// If the flag `G_CONVERTER_FLUSH` is set then conversion is modified
    /// to try to write out all internal state to the output. The application
    /// has to call the function multiple times with the flag set, and when
    /// the available input has been consumed and all internal state has
    /// been produced then `G_CONVERTER_FLUSHED` (or `G_CONVERTER_FINISHED` if
    /// really at the end) is returned instead of `G_CONVERTER_CONVERTED`.
    /// This is somewhat similar to what happens at the end of the input stream,
    /// but done in the middle of the data.
    /// 
    /// This has different meanings for different conversions. For instance
    /// in a compression converter it would mean that we flush all the
    /// compression state into output such that if you uncompress the
    /// compressed data you get back all the input data. Doing this may
    /// make the final file larger due to padding though. Another example
    /// is a regexp conversion, where if you at the end of the flushed data
    /// have a match, but there is also a potential longer match. In the
    /// non-flushed case we would ask for more input, but when flushing we
    /// treat this as the end of input and do the match.
    /// 
    /// Flushing is not always possible (like if a charset converter flushes
    /// at a partial multibyte sequence). Converters are supposed to try
    /// to produce as much output as possible and then return an error

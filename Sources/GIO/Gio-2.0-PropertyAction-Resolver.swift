// MARK: - PropertyAction Class

/// The `PropertyActionProtocol` protocol exposes the methods and properties of an underlying `GPropertyAction` instance.
/// The default implementation of these can be found in the protocol extension below.
/// For a concrete class that implements these methods and properties, see `PropertyAction`.
/// Alternatively, use `PropertyActionRef` as a lighweight, `unowned` reference if you already have an instance you just want to use.
///
/// A `GPropertyAction` is a way to get a `GAction` with a state value
/// reflecting and controlling the value of a `GObject` property.
/// 
/// The state of the action will correspond to the value of the property.
/// Changing it will change the property (assuming the requested value
/// matches the requirements as specified in the `GParamSpec`).
/// 
/// Only the most common types are presently supported.  Booleans are
/// mapped to booleans, strings to strings, signed/unsigned integers to
/// int32/uint32 and floats and doubles to doubles.
/// 
/// If the property is an enum then the state will be string-typed and
/// conversion will automatically be performed between the enum value and
/// "nick" string as per the `GEnumValue` table.
/// 
/// Flags types are not currently supported.
/// 
/// Properties of object types, boxed types and pointer types are not
/// supported and probably never will be.
/// 
/// Properties of `GVariant` types are not currently supported.
/// 
/// If the property is boolean-valued then the action will have a NULL
/// parameter type, and activating the action (with no parameter) will
/// toggle the value of the property.
/// 
/// In all other cases, the parameter type will correspond to the type of
/// the property.
/// 
/// The general idea here is to reduce the number of locations where a
/// particular piece of state is kept (and therefore has to be synchronised
/// between). `GPropertyAction` does not have a separate state that is kept
/// in sync with the property value -- its state is the property value.
/// 
/// For example, it might be useful to create a `GAction` corresponding to
/// the "visible-child-name" property of a `GtkStack` so that the current
/// page can be switched from a menu.  The active radio indication in the
/// menu is then directly determined from the active page of the
/// `GtkStack`.
/// 
/// An anti-example would be binding the "active-id" property on a
/// `GtkComboBox`.  This is because the state of the combobox itself is
/// probably uninteresting and is actually being used to control
/// something else.
/// 
/// Another anti-example would be to bind to the "visible-child-name"
/// property of a `GtkStack` if this value is actually stored in
/// `GSettings`.  In that case, the real source of the value is
/// `GSettings`.  If you want a `GAction` to control a setting stored in
/// `GSettings`, see `g_settings_create_action()` instead, and possibly
/// combine its use with `g_settings_bind()`.

// MARK: - Application Class

/// The `ApplicationProtocol` protocol exposes the methods and properties of an underlying `GApplication` instance.
/// The default implementation of these can be found in the protocol extension below.
/// For a concrete class that implements these methods and properties, see `Application`.
/// Alternatively, use `ApplicationRef` as a lighweight, `unowned` reference if you already have an instance you just want to use.
///
/// A `GApplication` is the foundation of an application.  It wraps some
/// low-level platform-specific services and is intended to act as the
/// foundation for higher-level application classes such as
/// `GtkApplication` or `MxApplication`.  In general, you should not use
/// this class outside of a higher level framework.
/// 
/// GApplication provides convenient life cycle management by maintaining
/// a "use count" for the primary application instance. The use count can
/// be changed using `g_application_hold()` and `g_application_release()`. If
/// it drops to zero, the application exits. Higher-level classes such as
/// `GtkApplication` employ the use count to ensure that the application
/// stays alive as long as it has any opened windows.
/// 
/// Another feature that GApplication (optionally) provides is process
/// uniqueness. Applications can make use of this functionality by
/// providing a unique application ID. If given, only one application
/// with this ID can be running at a time per session. The session
/// concept is platform-dependent, but corresponds roughly to a graphical
/// desktop login. When your application is launched again, its
/// arguments are passed through platform communication to the already
/// running program. The already running instance of the program is
/// called the "primary instance"; for non-unique applications this is
/// always the current instance. On Linux, the D-Bus session bus
/// is used for communication.
/// 
/// The use of `GApplication` differs from some other commonly-used
/// uniqueness libraries (such as libunique) in important ways. The
/// application is not expected to manually register itself and check
/// if it is the primary instance. Instead, the `main()` function of a
/// `GApplication` should do very little more than instantiating the
/// application instance, possibly connecting signal handlers, then
/// calling `g_application_run()`. All checks for uniqueness are done
/// internally. If the application is the primary instance then the
/// startup signal is emitted and the mainloop runs. If the application
/// is not the primary instance then a signal is sent to the primary
/// instance and `g_application_run()` promptly returns. See the code
/// examples below.
/// 
/// If used, the expected form of an application identifier is the same as
/// that of of a
/// [D-Bus well-known bus name](https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html`message-protocol-names-bus`).
/// Examples include: `com.example.MyApp`, `org.example.internal_apps.Calculator`,
/// `org._7_zip.Archiver`.
/// For details on valid application identifiers, see `g_application_id_is_valid()`.
/// 
/// On Linux, the application identifier is claimed as a well-known bus name
/// on the user's session bus.  This means that the uniqueness of your
/// application is scoped to the current session.  It also means that your
/// application may provide additional services (through registration of other
/// object paths) at that bus name.  The registration of these object paths
/// should be done with the shared GDBus session bus.  Note that due to the
/// internal architecture of GDBus, method calls can be dispatched at any time
/// (even if a main loop is not running).  For this reason, you must ensure that
/// any object paths that you wish to register are registered before `GApplication`
/// attempts to acquire the bus name of your application (which happens in
/// `g_application_register()`).  Unfortunately, this means that you cannot use
/// `g_application_get_is_remote()` to decide if you want to register object paths.
/// 
/// GApplication also implements the `GActionGroup` and `GActionMap`
/// interfaces and lets you easily export actions by adding them with
/// `g_action_map_add_action()`. When invoking an action by calling
/// `g_action_group_activate_action()` on the application, it is always
/// invoked in the primary instance. The actions are also exported on
/// the session bus, and GIO provides the `GDBusActionGroup` wrapper to
/// conveniently access them remotely. GIO provides a `GDBusMenuModel` wrapper
/// for remote access to exported `GMenuModels`.
/// 
/// There is a number of different entry points into a GApplication:
/// 
/// - via 'Activate' (i.e. just starting the application)
/// 
/// - via 'Open' (i.e. opening some files)
/// 
/// - by handling a command-line

/// The `ApplicationRef` type acts as a lightweight Swift reference to an underlying `GApplication` instance.
/// It exposes methods that can operate on this data type through `ApplicationProtocol` conformance.
/// Use `ApplicationRef` only as an `unowned` reference to an existing `GApplication` instance.
///
/// A `GApplication` is the foundation of an application.  It wraps some
/// low-level platform-specific services and is intended to act as the
/// foundation for higher-level application classes such as
/// `GtkApplication` or `MxApplication`.  In general, you should not use
/// this class outside of a higher level framework.
/// 
/// GApplication provides convenient life cycle management by maintaining
/// a "use count" for the primary application instance. The use count can
/// be changed using `g_application_hold()` and `g_application_release()`. If
/// it drops to zero, the application exits. Higher-level classes such as
/// `GtkApplication` employ the use count to ensure that the application
/// stays alive as long as it has any opened windows.
/// 
/// Another feature that GApplication (optionally) provides is process
/// uniqueness. Applications can make use of this functionality by
/// providing a unique application ID. If given, only one application
/// with this ID can be running at a time per session. The session
/// concept is platform-dependent, but corresponds roughly to a graphical
/// desktop login. When your application is launched again, its
/// arguments are passed through platform communication to the already
/// running program. The already running instance of the program is
/// called the "primary instance"; for non-unique applications this is
/// always the current instance. On Linux, the D-Bus session bus
/// is used for communication.
/// 
/// The use of `GApplication` differs from some other commonly-used
/// uniqueness libraries (such as libunique) in important ways. The
/// application is not expected to manually register itself and check
/// if it is the primary instance. Instead, the `main()` function of a
/// `GApplication` should do very little more than instantiating the
/// application instance, possibly connecting signal handlers, then
/// calling `g_application_run()`. All checks for uniqueness are done
/// internally. If the application is the primary instance then the
/// startup signal is emitted and the mainloop runs. If the application
/// is not the primary instance then a signal is sent to the primary
/// instance and `g_application_run()` promptly returns. See the code
/// examples below.
/// 
/// If used, the expected form of an application identifier is the same as
/// that of of a
/// [D-Bus well-known bus name](https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html`message-protocol-names-bus`).
/// Examples include: `com.example.MyApp`, `org.example.internal_apps.Calculator`,
/// `org._7_zip.Archiver`.
/// For details on valid application identifiers, see `g_application_id_is_valid()`.
/// 
/// On Linux, the application identifier is claimed as a well-known bus name
/// on the user's session bus.  This means that the uniqueness of your
/// application is scoped to the current session.  It also means that your
/// application may provide additional services (through registration of other
/// object paths) at that bus name.  The registration of these object paths
/// should be done with the shared GDBus session bus.  Note that due to the
/// internal architecture of GDBus, method calls can be dispatched at any time
/// (even if a main loop is not running).  For this reason, you must ensure that
/// any object paths that you wish to register are registered before `GApplication`
/// attempts to acquire the bus name of your application (which happens in
/// `g_application_register()`).  Unfortunately, this means that you cannot use
/// `g_application_get_is_remote()` to decide if you want to register object paths.
/// 
/// GApplication also implements the `GActionGroup` and `GActionMap`
/// interfaces and lets you easily export actions by adding them with
/// `g_action_map_add_action()`. When invoking an action by calling
/// `g_action_group_activate_action()` on the application, it is always
/// invoked in the primary instance. The actions are also exported on
/// the session bus, and GIO provides the `GDBusActionGroup` wrapper to
/// conveniently access them remotely. GIO provides a `GDBusMenuModel` wrapper
/// for remote access to exported `GMenuModels`.
/// 
/// There is a number of different entry points into a GApplication:
/// 
/// - via 'Activate' (i.e. just starting the application)
/// 
/// - via 'Open' (i.e. opening some files)
/// 
/// - by handling a command-line
/// 
/// - via activating an action
///

// MARK: - ApplicationCommandLine Class

/// The `ApplicationCommandLineProtocol` protocol exposes the methods and properties of an underlying `GApplicationCommandLine` instance.
/// The default implementation of these can be found in the protocol extension below.
/// For a concrete class that implements these methods and properties, see `ApplicationCommandLine`.
/// Alternatively, use `ApplicationCommandLineRef` as a lighweight, `unowned` reference if you already have an instance you just want to use.
///
/// `GApplicationCommandLine` represents a command-line invocation of
/// an application.  It is created by `GApplication` and emitted
/// in the `GApplication::command-line` signal and virtual function.
/// 
/// The class contains the list of arguments that the program was invoked
/// with.  It is also possible to query if the commandline invocation was
/// local (ie: the current process is running in direct response to the
/// invocation) or remote (ie: some other process forwarded the
/// commandline to this process).
/// 
/// The GApplicationCommandLine object can provide the `argc` and `argv`
/// parameters for use with the `GOptionContext` command-line parsing API,
/// with the `g_application_command_line_get_arguments()` function. See
/// [gapplication-example-cmdline3.c](#gapplication-example-cmdline3)
/// for an example.
/// 
/// The exit status of the originally-invoked process may be set and
/// messages can be printed to stdout or stderr of that process.  The
/// lifecycle of the originally-invoked process is tied to the lifecycle
/// of this object (ie: the process exits when the last reference is
/// dropped).
/// 
/// The main use for `GApplicationCommandLine` (and the
/// `GApplication::command-line` signal) is 'Emacs server' like use cases:
/// You can set the `EDITOR` environment variable to have e.g. git use
/// your favourite editor to edit commit messages, and if you already
/// have an instance of the editor running, the editing will happen
/// in the running instance, instead of opening a new one. An important
/// aspect of this use case is that the process that gets started by git
/// does not return until the editing is done.
/// 
/// Normally, the commandline is completely handled in the
/// `GApplication::command-line` handler. The launching instance exits
/// once the signal handler in the primary instance has returned, and
/// the return value of the signal handler becomes the exit status
/// of the launching instance.
/// (C Language Example):
/// ```C
/// static int
/// command_line (GApplication            *application,
///               GApplicationCommandLine *cmdline)
/// {
///   gchar **argv;
///   gint argc;
///   gint i;
/// 
///   argv = g_application_command_line_get_arguments (cmdline, &argc);
/// 
///   g_application_command_line_print (cmdline,
///                                     "This text is written back\n"
///                                     "to stdout of the caller\n");
/// 
///   for (i = 0; i < argc; i++)
///     g_print ("argument %d: %s\n", i, argv[i]);
/// 
///   g_strfreev (argv);
/// 
///   return 0;
/// }
/// ```
/// The complete example can be found here:
/// [gapplication-example-cmdline.c](https://git.gnome.org/browse/glib/tree/gio/tests/gapplication-example-cmdline.c)
/// 
/// In more complicated cases, the handling of the comandline can be
/// split between the launcher and the primary instance.
